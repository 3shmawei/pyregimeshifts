General information:
--------------------

Python scripts run in Python 2.x and use standard Python packages numpy,
scipy etc (latest versions in 2014). Additionally, the package pyunicorn
needs to be installed on the system (see below).

Results of the recurrence analysis are stored in Python cPickle (.pickle)
files to be loaded by plotting scripts.

Information on and latest version of Python package pyunicorn can be
obtained here:
http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/pyunicorn.php

Information on and latest version of Matlab package COPRA (Constructing
Proxy Records From Age Models) can be obtained here:
http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/copra.php

Note that for some figures, the layout has been modified using Adobe Illustrator based on the plots generated by the Python scripts described below.


Material in this publication data entry:
----------------------------------------

1. Raw speleothem proxy data (10 data files, one for each cave):
a) data/raw_proxy_data/*.dat

2. COPRA ensemble data (10 data files, one for each cave, each contains
1000 realizations of the proxy record):
a) data/copra_ensemble_data/*.txt

3. Scripts for computing and plotting auto-correlation functions (Fig. 5):
a) scripts/auto_correlation_function/auto_correlation_copra.py
(reproduce Fig. 5)
b) scripts/auto_correlation_function/auto_correlation_irregular_sampling.py
(compute auto-correlation function for irregularly sampled data, produces
part of Fig. 5 - kernel_acf_dongge.txt - that is loaded by the script 3a)
c) kernel_acf_dongge.txt
(Auto-correlation function of Dongge DA record computed using 3b)

4. Scripts for analyzing and plotting of raw proxy data (Figs. 4,7,8,9):
a) scripts/raw_proxy_records_analysis/recurrence_analysis_speleo_raw.py
(Performs recurrence analysis for set of raw proxy records and stores results)
b) scripts/raw_proxy_records_analysis/recurrence_analysis_speleo_raw_plot.py
(Plots results of 4a, Figs. 4, 7, 8)
c) scripts/raw_proxy_records_analysis/speleo_summary_statistics_raw.py
(Computes and plots summary statistics based on results of 4a, Fig. 9)

5. Scripts for analyzing and plotting of COPRA ensembles (Figs. 10,A1,A2,A3):
a) scripts/copra_ensembles_analysis/recurrence_analysis_copra_ensemble_single_record.py
(Performs recurrence analysis for the COPRA ensemble associated to a single
proxy record)
b) scripts/copra_ensembles_analysis/recurrence_analysis_copra_ensemble_multiple_records_plot.py
(Plots results of 5a for several proxy records, Figs. A1, A2, A3)
c) scripts/copra_ensembles_analysis/speleo_summary_statistics_copra.py
(Computes and plots summary statistics based on results of 5a for several
proxy records, Fig. 10)

6. Script for plotting comparative figure for Dongge DA record (Fig. 6):
a) scripts/copra_ensembles_analysis/recurrence_analysis_copra_ensemble_single_record_plot.py
(Plots results of recurrence analysis of single raw proxy record [from 4a]
and its associated COPRA ensemble [from 5a], Fig. 6)

7. Software packages:
a) packages/copra/*
(Matlab package COPRA for generating COPRA ensemble from raw proxy record)
b) packages/pyunicorn/*
(Python package pyunicorn 0.5.1 for performing recurrence analysis)

8. Results of recurrence analysis as reported in paper stored in cPickle files
(these can be plotted using the plotting scripts listed above):
a) results/raw_proxy_records/results_speleo_comparison_W_750.0y_M_1000_DETREND_True.pickle
(Results for set of 10 raw proxy records with parameters as reported in paper)
b) results/copra_ensembles/*.pickle
(Results for set of 10 COPRA ensembles with parameters as reported in paper)
